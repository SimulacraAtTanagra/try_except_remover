## The purpose of this project is as follows:
This program removes all try/except blocks from a python file, defaulting to the try arguments and correcting indentation.
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
This program is completely arbitrary and is not, in any way, useful. I only made it to be snarky on reddit. 
This project uses only python built-in functions and data types.
## In order to use this, you'll first need do the following:
I you run this file once with the throaway py fie in the src folder, it will work. You won't be able to run it again.
The expected frequency for running this code is As Needed.
